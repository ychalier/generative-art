## Description

This effect shows lines on a noisy canvas solely using movement. If you pause the animation at any time, you only see noise. Lines are "drawn" by inverting pixels at the line location. To see them, you need to rely on your eye's persistence of vision, its capacity to average images from the near past, which creates a grey region that your brain can identify.

Inspired by a [Chris Long](https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisBLong) video, *[Weird POV effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdTMeNXCnTs)*.

## Demo Parameters

Press `L` to add a line, press `M` to remove a line.

At the bottom right corner, there is a range input to control the animation speed. Setting this input close to zero helps with understanding the effect.
