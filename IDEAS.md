In this document, we gather ideas for further implementations.

## Glitch Art Subreddit

There is a subreddit dedicate to glitch art, namely [r/glitch_art](https://www.reddit.com/r/glitch_art). Here are some examples from it:

- [Dancer](https://www.reddit.com/r/glitch_art/comments/wkm37v/dancer/)
- [Spaces Waves](https://www.reddit.com/r/glitch_art/comments/wbksiz/space_waves/)

## Concentric circles formula

A way of generating concentric waves pattern is to use the cosinus on the l2 norm of the plan:

$$\cos\left({\lambda\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\right)$$
